README is a file that descripts whatever files that I have to submit on CCLE.

lab4b.c is a source file that can run with Edison kits to see what the temperature 
is right now at a certain place. 

test.txt is just a test file when I input all commands in that file and pipe it into
	 the a program to test it. Note that you can do it by only running ./lab4b 
	 and input commands one by one.

LOGFILE is just a log file that contain everything output if the user uses log option.
 
Makefile 
	 default: make the source file into a runnable file
	 check: execute an automated smoke-test of your application to see if it 
	 runs and can talk to its sensors/actuators.
	 clean: delete all programs and output generated by the Makefile
	 dist: create the deliverable tarball
