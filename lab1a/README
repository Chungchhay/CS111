README is a file that contains descriptions about other files. 

lab1a.c is a source file that runs in the program. This source file is broken
up into many functions. And I also commented some of the functions but other
functions should be obvious for you to understand the meanings of the functions
by its name. There are also a bunch of global variables as well. A good example
from my code is shellFlag, when it is 1, I know that it is running with the shell.

Makefile:
	default is just a standard default to run a C source file
	clean is used to clean the lab1a file and other files that are created by Makefile
	dist is used to compressed 3 files such as lab1a.c Makefile README
