lab0.c contains all of my source codes for this lab. The program uses getopt_long to
create options and check for options to identify if it is input, output, segfault or 
other options. I created one option for input, another one for output, one for segfault, 
one for catching segmentation fault. I also created 
read write function from file descriptor 0 to file descriptor 1 byte by byte by 
using read and write functions. When getting segmentation fault 's', I handled it
setting a char * pointer to NULL and then stores through the null pointer. For the 
default option in the switch statement, I print out "Incorrect arguments, please pass 
the correct argument" and exit it with a return 1. 

Makefile contains all the test for lab0. For example:
make default will create an executable file.
make check will check all the smoke test, and I ran it, I passed all of my make check test
     Notice that I only check for my input and output arguments since backtrace.png and 
     breakpoint.png will take care of the other 2 arguments.
make clean will remove the executable file.
make dist will create a tar.gz file.

README contains all the information about this lab. 

backtrace.png is just a screenshot for segfault within gdb and show backtrace from the segfault

breakpoint.png is just a screenshot that tells us there is actually a null pointer as being null. 
It shows a break point at the bad assigment.
